7. Update Help and instructions pages as shown below

### (B)Installing using VM image:
1. Download VM:
2. Deploy VM in virtualization environment of your choice and add the image as HDD.
3. Open .env (vim ./arguesecure-online/.env) and change WEBSOCKET_IP to whatever the IP of the page will be. Also change APP_DEBUG to false.
4. Open config/app.php (vim ./arguesecure-online/config/app.php) and change 'url' => 'http://argue.app' (line 32), to whatever the IP/URL of the page will be.
5. Set up port forwarding on port 80 and 3002 (if not changed, as shown below)
