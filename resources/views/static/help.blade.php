	</div>
	<div class="panel-body argue-tree-description">
		ArgueSecure is a ditributed risk assessment platform with real-time collaboration functionality.<br>
		The platform allows users to collaboratively or privately build and maintain structured lists of risks and mitigations for software and/or systems.
		Each risk assessment (i.e. each list of risks and mitigations) follows a fixed, tree-like structure:
		<ul>
			<li>Risk 1</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Attack 1</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Defence/Transfer 1</li>
					<li>Defence/Transfer 2</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Attack 2</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Defence/Transfer 1</li>
					<li>Defence/Transfer 3</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>		
			<li>Risk 2</li>
			<li>Etc.</li>
		</ul>
		Defences refer to components or architectural decisions that reduce a risk; transfers refer to decisions, disclaimers, or policies that shift the risk or potential loss to another party through a contract (e.g., a hold harmless clause) or to a professional risk bearer (e.g. to an insurance company).
