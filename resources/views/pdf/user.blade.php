<h2>
	REFSQ is great! <br>
	But have you ever asked yourself: “what could possibly go wrong…?”
</h2>

<p>
This year, we are running a live study throughout the duration of the conference to evaluate a new, web-based collaborative risk assessment methodology &amp; tool: ArgueSecure. As a REFSQ participant, you can access the ArgueSecure platform from any web-enabled device by simply accessing the following URL: <a href="{{$url}}"><{{$url}}/a>
</p>

<p>
Your personal, anonymous credentials are:<br>
Username: <strong>{{$user->name}}</strong><br>
Password: <strong>{{$user->password}}</strong><br>

<p>Also at any time during the conference, but preferably after you have familiarized yourself with the ArgueSecure tool, please access our online questionnaire to rate the experience: <a href="{{$questionnaireUrl}}">{{$questionnaireUrl}}</a></p>

If you have any problems, questions or suggestions, please contact d.ionita@utwente.nl
